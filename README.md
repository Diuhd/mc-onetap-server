# mc-onetap-server
Run a single exe file, make your own Minecraft Server.
Made by C++, this project lets you make your own Minecraft Server and lets you run it just with one exe file.

WARNING: This project is in very heavy development. Expect bugs and problems among the code.

# Requirements:
C++17+ (recommended)
Windows 7+

# How to use:
Go to the latest release in the Releases Section and download the .exe file.
Just run the file in Windows, and the server will be made in seconds. All server related files are in C:\mcserver directory.
Errors will be printed if any collision happens in the code or cannot reach out to files.
Input "quit" in the command prompt (not server console) to forcefully end both programs.

# Future Changes
Being able to select your own directory
Being able to select the version of the server
Being able to select the server.jar file
Adding a user friendly GUI
